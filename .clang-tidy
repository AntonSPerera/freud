# Specific checks ignored:
# readability-avoid-const-params-in-decls: While it may be semantically confusing, it's easier to read when declaration and definition consts match.
# readability-redundant-member-init: If the constructor changes or if there are multiple constructor signatures, prefer to be explicit.
# modernize-use-trailing-return-type: This syntax is still generally unfamiliar to many developers and will make the code harder to maintain.
# misc-no-recursion: Rewriting things like the NeighborList to avoid recursion is out of scope for now.
# readability-magic-numbers: Wigner3j contains (necessary) magic numbers.
# misc-non-private-member-variables-in-classes: We make extensive use of protected members, for instance in PMFT* classes from BondHistogramCompute, and the argument that this is _never_ OK is not terribly convincing.
# modernize-return-braced-init-list: This format for returning is less readable for inexperienced C++ programmers.
